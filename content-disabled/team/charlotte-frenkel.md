title: "Charlotte Frenkel"
description: "Charlotte Frenkel is an Assistant Professor at the Microelectronics department of Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands. 


Her research goals are:

- to demonstrate a competitive advantage for neuromorphic computing devices compared to conventional neural network accelerators,

- to uncover a framework toward on-chip neuromorphic intelligence for adaptive edge computing.


To achieve these goals, she is investigating both the bottom-up and the top-down design approaches, as well as their synergies.

She is the designer of the [ODIN](https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ODIN) and [ReckOn](https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ReckOn) open-source online-learning digital neuromorphic processors."
