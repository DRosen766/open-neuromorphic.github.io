# Open Neuromorphic

This website is based on the [Jekyll Serif theme](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/jekyll-serif-theme) by [zero static](http://www.zerostatic.io).

## Pending tasks

This website is a work in progress. Remaining to be done: 
- [ ] match color scheme to logo
- [ ] replace images
- [ ] add content

## Setup

First install Jekyll, see instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

To run the theme locally, run:
```
bundle install
```

To start the Jekyll local development server:
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

To build the website:
```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

## Deploying to Github Pages

When using Github Pages you will need to update the `baseurl` in the `_config.yml` otherwise all the css, images and paths will be broken.

For example the site https://zerostaticthemes.github.io/jekyll-serif-theme would have `baseurl: "/jekyll-serif-theme/"`
