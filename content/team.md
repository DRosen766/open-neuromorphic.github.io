## Fabrizio Ottati - Founder

{{< image src="/img/team/fabrizio-ottati.jpg" alt="fabrizio-ottati" >}}

Fabrizio Ottati is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronics and Communications of Politecnico di Torino, under the supervision of professor Luciano Lavagno and professor Mario Roberto Casu.

His main interests are event-based cameras, digital IC design, spiking neural networks and piedmontese red wine. He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) and [expelliarmus](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus). You can find more information on his [website](https://fabrizio-ottati.github.io).

## Gregor Lenz - Founder

Gregor Lenz graduated with a Ph.D. in neuromorphic engineering from Sorbonne University. He thinks that technology can learn a thing or two from how biological systems process information. 

His main interests are event cameras that are inspired by the human retina and spiking neural networks that mimic human brain in an effort to teach machines to compute a bit more like humans do. At the very least there are some power efficiency gains to be made, but hopefully more! Also he loves to build open source software for spike-based machine learning.

Jason Eshraghian is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, leading the [UCSC Neuromorphic Computing Group](http://ncg.ucsc.edu/).

His research focuses on brain-inspired circuit design to accelerate AI algorithms and spiking neural networks. You can find more information on his personal [website](https://www.jasoneshraghian.com/).

He is the maintainer of [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch).

## Charlotte Frenkel - Founder

{{< image src="/img/team/charlotte-frenkel.jpg" alt="charlotte-frenkel" >}}

Charlotte Frenkel is a digital IC designer whose curiosity got trapped into the realms of neuromorphic engineering. She is working on aspects ranging from circuit design techniques (both digital and mixed-signal with emerging devices) to computer architecture, learning algorithms, and neuroscience. Her research goals are:

- to demonstrate a competitive advantage for neuromorphic computing devices compared to conventional neural network accelerators,
- to uncover a framework toward on-chip neuromorphic intelligence for adaptive edge computing.

To achieve these goals, she is investigating both the bottom-up and the top-down design approaches, as well as their synergies.

She is currently an [Assistant Professor](http://microelectronics.tudelft.nl/People/bio.php?id=822) in the Microelectronics department of TU Delft. You can find more information on her [personal website](https://chfrenkel.github.io).

## Jens Egholm Pedersen - Member

{{< image src="/img/team/jens-egholm.png" alt="jens-egholm" >}}

Jens Egholm Pedersen is a doctoral student at the [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/profile/jeped/) working to model and construct [neuromorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering) control systems.

When faced with the complexity and ambiguity in the real world, contemporary algorithms fail spectacularly. There is a strong need for self-correcting, closed-loop systems to help solve our everyday physical problems.

By simulating and carefully scrutinizing and understanding neural circuits, including vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, Jens seeks to build autonomous systems that perform meaningful work, tightly following the Feynman axiom "What I cannot create, I do not understand". You can find more information on his [website](https://jepedersen.dk/).

He is the maintainer of [norse](https://github.com/norse/norse) and [AEStream](https:github.com/norse/aestream).

## Steven Abreu - Member

{{< image src="/img/team/steven-abreu.jpg" alt="steven-abreu" >}}

Steve is doing his PhD on neuromorphic computing theory in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) research group at the new [CogniGron](https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/cognitive-systems-and-materials/about/) center for cognitive systems and materials in Groningen. He is funded by the European [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk/) research network.

In his PhD, he works with different neuromorphic systems ([Loihi 2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/neuromorphic-computing.html), [DynapSE2](https://www.synsense.ai/products/dynap-se2/), and [photonic reservoirs](https://photonics.intec.ugent.be/research/topics.asp?ID=112)) to develop programming methods for devices that explore a richer set of physical dynamics than the synchronous bi-stable switching that (most of) computer science relies on. Steve's background is in computer science and machine learning, with a touch of physics.

## Alexander Henkes - Member

{{< image src="/img/team/alexander-henkes.jpg" alt="alexander-henkes" >}}

Alexander Henkes received the B.Sc. (Mechanical engineering) and M.Sc. (Mechanical engineering) degrees from University of Paderborn, Germany, in 2015 and 2018, respectively. In 2022 he received his Ph.D with honors from the Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS), Germany, for his thesis "Artificial Neural Networks in Continuum Micromechanics".

He is currently a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Institute for Computational Modeling in Civil Engineering at TUBS. In 2022, he was elected as a junior member of the German Association of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (GAMM) for his outstanding research in the field of artificial intelligence in continuum micromechanics.

His current research focuses on spiking neural networks (SNN). Recently he published a preprint on nonlinear history-dependent regression using SNN. This enables SNN to be used in the context of applied mathematics and computational engineering.

He is a contributor of [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch).

## Alexander Hadjiivanov - Member

{{< image src="/img/team/alexander-hadjiivanov.jpeg" alt="alexander-hadjiivanov" >}}

Alexander is currently a Research Fellow with the Advanced Concepts Team at the European Space Agency. His research efforts are focused on retinomorphic vision as well as the interplay between homeostasis, adaptation, axon guidance and structural plasticity in spiking neural networks. 

No single branch of AI can claim the crown of true intelligence on its own. Rather, developing AI worthy of the 'I' would require a concerted effort to combine virtually all the branches - from perception through learning and cognition to reasoning and interaction. The most enticing aspect of neuromorphic computing is its potential to bring about this unification.

## Peng Zhou - Member

Peng Zhou received the Ph.D. degree from The University of California, Santa Cruz, under the supervision of Prof. Sung-Mo “Steve” Kang and Prof. [Jason Eshraghian](https://jasoneshraghian.com), and focused on neuromorphic computing, spiking neural networks, and their hardware implementation using memristors.

She was awarded “Best New Neuromorph” at the 2022 Telluride Workshop on Neuromorphic Cognition Engineering. She also obtained working experience from [Synsense](https://synsense.ai), a neuromorphic startup that spun out of the Institute of Neuroinformatics at the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, and [Tetramem](https://www.tetramem.com/), a computing-in-memory startup whose RRAM technologies are based on Yang research group at USC, Nanodevices and Integrated Systems Laboratory at UMass Amherst, and HP labs.

She is a contributor of the open-source SNN frameworks [snnTorch](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io) and [Rockpool](https://synsense.gitlab.io/rockpool/). She also designs open-source SNN chips.
