## Fabrizio Ottati - Founder

{{< image src="/img/team/fabrizio-ottati.jpg" alt="fabrizio-ottati" >}}

Fabrizio Ottati is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronics and Communications of Politecnico di Torino, under the supervision of professor Luciano Lavagno and professor Mario Roberto Casu.

His main interests are event-based cameras, digital IC design, spiking neural networks and piedmontese red wine. He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) and [expelliarmus](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus). You can find more information on his [website](https://fabhertz95.github.io).

## Gregor Lenz - Founder

Gregor Lenz graduated with a Ph.D. in neuromorphic engineering from Sorbonne University. He thinks that technology can learn a thing or two from how biological systems process information. 

His main interests are event cameras that are inspired by the human retina and spiking neural networks that mimic human brain in an effort to teach machines to compute a bit more like humans do. At the very least there are some power efficiency gains to be made, but hopefully more! Also he loves to build open source software for spike-based machine learning.

Jason Eshraghian is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, leading the [UCSC Neuromorphic Computing Group](http://ncg.ucsc.edu/).

His research focuses on brain-inspired circuit design to accelerate AI algorithms and spiking neural networks. You can find more information on his personal [website](https://www.jasoneshraghian.com/).

He is the maintainer of [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch).

## Jens Egholm Pedersen - Member

Jens Egholm Pedersen is a doctoral student at the [Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/profile/jeped/) working to model and construct [neuromorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering) control systems.

When faced with the complexity and ambiguity in the real world, contemporary algorithms fail spectacularly. There is a strong need for self-correcting, closed-loop systems to help solve our everyday physical problems.

By simulating and carefully scrutinizing and understanding neural circuits, including vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, Jens seeks to build autonomous systems that perform meaningful work, tightly following the Feynman axiom "What I cannot create, I do not understand".

He is the maintainer of [norse](https://github.com/norse/norse) and [AEStream](https:github.com/norse/aestream).

## Steven Abreu - Member

{{< image src="/img/team/steven-abreu.jpg" alt="steven-abreu" >}}

Steve Abreu is interested in interdisciplinary research in and around computer science and artificial intelligence: nature-inspired computing, understanding human cognition, and advancing artificial intelligence.

His Ph.D. is on non-digital computing theory in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/) research group and the CogniGron research center, funded by the [European Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk/) research network. He is developing concepts and methods for programming and interfacing with unconventional computers. He is working with analog neuromorphic hardware (spikes!), photonic computing systems, and other physical systems that can compute and/or learn.

In his free time, he is a hobby photographer, likes to read, travel, and go to music and art events. You can find more information on his [website](https://stevenabreu.com/).
