- description: 'Steve is doing his PhD on neuromorphic computing theory in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/)
    research group at the new [CogniGron](https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/cognitive-systems-and-materials/about/)
    center for cognitive systems and materials in Groningen. He is funded by the European
    [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk/) research network.


    In his PhD, he works with different neuromorphic systems ([Loihi 2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/neuromorphic-computing.html),
    [DynapSE2](https://www.synsense.ai/products/dynap-se2/), and [photonic reservoirs](https://photonics.intec.ugent.be/research/topics.asp?ID=112))
    to develop programming methods for devices that explore a richer set of physical
    dynamics than the synchronous bi-stable switching that (most of) computer science
    relies on. Steve''s background is in computer science and machine learning, with
    a touch of physics.'
