Have you wondered how to use neuromorphic hardware platforms?

Are you depressed by your power bill after you bought your >400W GPU rig?

Then you came to the right place!

In this workshop, we will show you how to move models from your favourite framework directly to neuromorphic hardware with 1-2 lines of code!
We will present the technology behind, the [Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation](https://github.com/neuromorphs/nir), and demonstrate how we can use it to run a live spiking convnet on the [Speck](https://www.synsense.ai/products/speck-2/) chip.

NIR is currently supported by [Intel Loihi](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-unveils-neuromorphic-loihi-2-lava-software.html), [Speck](https://www.synsense.ai/products/speck-2/), [SpiNNaker2](https://spinncloud.com/portfolio/spinnaker2/), [Xylo](https://www.synsense.ai/products/xylo/) and a host of simulators, including [Norse](https://norse.github.io/norse/), [snnTorch](https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and [Spyx](https://spyx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Join us on the 5th of February to get your own hands-on experience with NIR and neuromorphic hardware!

All it requires is a computer and a bit of Python knowledge.

**Agenda:**
- 18:00 - 19:00: NIR introduction
  - Motivation: coupling neuromorphic hardware and software
  - Demonstrating NIR: from PyTorch to Speck
  - Q&A 
- 19:00 - 20:00: Workshop
  - Hands-on experience with NIR via Jupyter Notebooks or custom models
  - Q&A and collaborative discussions

**Speakers:**
- [Jens E. Pedersen](https://jepedersen.dk), PhD at the [Neurocomputing Systems lab](https://neurocomputing.systems) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden

**Note:** The event will be hosted virtually. Stay tuned for the video link and further updates.
