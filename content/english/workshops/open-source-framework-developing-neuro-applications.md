### Speakers' bios

Andreas Wild received the Dr. rer. nat degree in physics with a focus on the development of silicon-based electron spin qubits from the Technical University of Munich, Germany, in 2013. After joining Intel in 2013, he has been a Senior Researcher with the Intel Neuromorphic Computing Lab since 2015 where he leads algorithm research.

Mathis Richter is a Research Scientist in the Neuromorphic Computing Lab at Intel Labs, where he leads the Application Software team, developing commercial software solutions based on neuromorphic technology. Before joining Intel in 2021, he worked as a post doc and PhD student on neural process models of higher cognition at the Institute for Neural Computation, Ruhr-University Bochum.
