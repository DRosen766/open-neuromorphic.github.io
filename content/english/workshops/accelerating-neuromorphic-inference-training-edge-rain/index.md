speaker_bio: 'I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique and the University of Cambridge in 2016 in applied mathematics and theoretical physics. I did my PhD in "neuromorphic computing" at Sorbonne University in collaboration with Mila where I specialized in hardware-friendly alternatives to backprop and helped to scale some of them up, including Equilibrium Propagation and Difference Target Propagation, alongside Ben Scellier, Blake Richards and Yoshua Bengio. I joined IBM Research in 2021 to work on AI safety, then started at Rain in 2022.'

I will present Rain's vision and technological roadmap to build hardware optimized for inference and training at the edge, from hardware to algorithms. I will also try to convey why physical and mathematical principles matter more in my eyes than biological inspiration.
