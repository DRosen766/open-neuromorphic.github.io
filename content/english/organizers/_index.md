- description: 'Gregor Lenz graduated with a Ph.D. in neuromorphic engineering from
    Sorbonne University. He thinks that technology can learn a thing or two from how
    biological systems process information.


    His main interests are event cameras that are inspired by the human retina and
    spiking neural networks that mimic human brain in an effort to teach machines
    to compute a bit more like humans do. At the very least there are some power efficiency
    gains to be made, but hopefully more! Also he loves to build open source software
    for spike-based machine learning.


    He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic
    computing, [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) and [expelliarmus](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus).'
