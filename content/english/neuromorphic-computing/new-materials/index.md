## New materials
Apart from memristors, there's a wide range of new materials that are being incorporated into brain-inspired computing hardware. 
Phase change materials can switch between crystalline and amorphous states in response to electrical pulses. This switching mimics the firing of biological neurons. 
Ferroelectric materials have switchable spontaneous electric polarization states that can represent synaptic weights. 
Organic polymers that conduct ions can be used to mimic neurotransmitter release in synapses. Silicon nanowires and carbon nanotubes act as transistors and synaptic connections in neuromorphic hardware. Their size approaches the scale of biological neurons. Graphene's electrical properties, flexibility, and strength are desirable for neuromorphic circuit elements like transistors and electrodes.
