## Analog vs digital hardware
Carver Mead pioneered the idea of using analog hardware to closely mimic the parallel processing and continuous signaling of biological neural networks. An example of this is a single transistor that is operated in the sub-threshold domain to imitate a synapse. Analog neuromorphic circuits hold promise for fast, energy-efficient computing, but face challenges with noise, limited precision, and calibration difficulties that can undermine accuracy.
In contrast, digital neuromorphic systems employ robust, discrete on/off signaling and reliable binary logic gates. They readily scale to larger networks with precise, noise-resistant computation and build on the decades of advancements humanity has made when building digital chips. The deterministic nature of digital hardware also simplifies algorithm exploration and adaptation. However, digital systems tend to be less power-efficient and may have difficulty efficiently simulating certain neural behaviors.
