## Use cases
Neuromorphic computing can be selectively integrated with conventional computing methods. For instance, event camera data could feed into standard computer vision models for optimal accuracy, or traditional images could run on neuromorphic hardware while skipping zero values. However, the greatest energy efficiency emerges from unifying the full neuromorphic pipeline - sensors, algorithms, and hardware.
When considering energy-constrained use cases, numerous edge computing applications come to mind:

* Robotics: navigation, control, planning
* Sensory integration: vision, audio, touch and olfactory neuromorphic sensors
* Optimization: resource management and scheduling
* Biomedical signals such as ECG, EMG, EEG: ultra-low-power monitoring 
* Brain-machine interfaces: Pre-process brain signals using the spikes directly
* Anything that needs high frame rate cameras: event cameras do it faster at lower power
* Any on-board processing on battery-powered systems in remote locations: deep sea, space, deserts
