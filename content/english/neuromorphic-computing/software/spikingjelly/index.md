## Overview
SpikingJelly is an open-source deep learning framework designed for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on PyTorch. It aims to bring brain-inspired intelligence to neuromorphic chips with high energy efficiency by incorporating neural dynamics and spike properties. SpikingJelly addresses the need for automatic differentiation, parallel computation acceleration, and integration of neuromorphic datasets in the spiking deep learning paradigm. The framework provides a full-stack toolkit for preprocessing neuromorphic datasets, constructing deep SNNs, optimizing parameters, and deploying on neuromorphic chips. It offers significant speed advantages and extensibility, allowing for the acceleration of custom models through inheritance and semiautomatic code generation. Developed by the Multimedia Learning Group, Institute of Digital Media (NELVT) at Peking University, and Peng Cheng Laboratory, SpikingJelly is contributing to the evolution of energy-efficient, spike-based machine intelligence systems【76†source】.
