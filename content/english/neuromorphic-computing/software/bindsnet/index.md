## Overview
**BindsNET** is an open-source computational framework designed for the simulation of spiking neural networks (SNNs), built atop the PyTorch deep learning platform. It provides tools and functionality for creating, managing, and simulating networks of spiking neurons and synapses, harnessing the power of GPUs for acceleration. BindsNET supports the integration of standard vision datasets, facilitating its use in computer vision tasks, and incorporates mechanisms for synaptic plasticity, crucial for learning and memory. The project is accompanied by extensive documentation, including installation guides, a user manual, and detailed reference material, making it accessible for researchers and practitioners in the field of computational neuroscience and machine learning.
