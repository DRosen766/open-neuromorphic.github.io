## Overview
Lava is an open-source software framework designed for neuromorphic computing, aiming to facilitate the development of neuro-inspired applications and their mapping to neuromorphic hardware. It offers a modular, composable, and extensible structure for integrating diverse algorithms and supports a wide range of neuron models, network topologies, and training tools. Lava is platform-agnostic, allowing prototyping on CPUs/GPUs and deployment to various neuromorphic chips, and integrates with third-party frameworks. Key features include channel-based message passing, hyper-granular parallelism, and tools for creating complex spiking neural networks, aiming for high energy efficiency and speed.
