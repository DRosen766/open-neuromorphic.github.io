## Overview
Nengo is a versatile Python package known as the "Brain Maker," designed for building, testing, and deploying neural networks, both spiking and non-spiking. It offers fully scriptable or GUI-based development, allowing for dynamic information processing and adaptability to the latest hardware. Nengo is extensible, enabling users to define custom neuron types, learning rules, and optimization methods. It's used across various domains, including deep learning, cognitive modeling, motor control, and more. Nengo's robust environment supports large-scale neural simulations, making it a powerful tool for both research and application in neural computation.
