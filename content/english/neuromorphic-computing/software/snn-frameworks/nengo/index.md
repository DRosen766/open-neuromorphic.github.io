## Overview
**Nengo**, also known as "Brain Maker", is a versatile open-source Python package, designed for building, testing, and applying neural networks, supporting many backends for 
spiking neural networks (SNNs). Developed and maintained by Trevor Bekolov, Nengo accompanies a comprehensive and extensive documentation that covers all of their applications and
example implementations of Nengo applications for newcomers to follow. The framework has a large and passionate community that support and contribute to Nengo.

Nengo is unique for its seamless compatability with many different applications FPGA boards, Intel's Loihi chip, TensorFlow, a HTML-5 interactive visualizer, and PyTorch to name a
few. The project supports a wide range of neuron types and is higly adaptable, allowing users to deploy various cognitive and perceptual models on both conventional and neuromorphic
hardware. With Nengo's wide variety of applications they provide a user-friendly syntax and high-level abstractions that make it accessible for both researchers and newcomers to
deep learning and neural networks.
