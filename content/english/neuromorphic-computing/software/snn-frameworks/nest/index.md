## Overview
**NEST** is a prominent open-source simulator for spiking neural network (SNN) models, mainly used in computational neuroscience. The project is developed and maintained by the NEST
Initiative, they have advanced computational neuroscience by pushing the limits of large-scale simulations of SNNs. They heavily encourage and support community involvement through
a robust community of developers who contribute and maintain the simulator. Along with their passionate community, NEST has a lot of documentation on their simulator including a
documented movie, an information brochure, and tutorials.

The framework focuses on the dynamics, size and structure of neural networks rather than on the morphology of individual neurons, it aims to simulate the logic of electrophysiological
experiment. NEST offers support for more than 50 neuron models and over 10 synapse models, allowing for customization through user-defined models. It excels in high-precision 
simulations of large networks, capable of handling millions and billions of synaptic connections.The user-friendly syntax enables for efficient and convenient commands to define and
connect large networks.

NEST is equipped with a Python interface for ease of use and integrates well with other neuroinformatics tools, as well as excels in efficient parallel computing making it suitable
for high performance simulations and is memory and energy efficient. The library has many capabilities and applications that have been explored by researchers, practioners, and
newcomers into the computational neuroscience field.
