## Overview
NEST is a prominent simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the dynamics, size, and structure of neural systems, rather than the exact morphology of individual neurons. It's designed to model networks of spiking neurons for various scales and types of projects, such as brain area simulations and learning models. NEST is accessible through Python or as a standalone application and supports a diverse range of neuron and synapse models. It's highly efficient, extensible, and offers detailed modification of network states during simulations. NEST has been developed collaboratively by a large community and is open-source, licensed under the GNU General Public License.
