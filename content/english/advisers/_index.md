- description: 'Melika Payvand is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Neuroinformatics,
    University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. She received her PhD in Electrical and Computer
    Engineering at the University of California Santa Barbara.


    Her recent research interest is in developing on-device learning systems that
    form themselves to the sensory input in a real-time fashion.  Specifically, she
    exploits the physics of resistive memory for synaptic, neuronal, dendritic and
    structural plasticity, inspired by the structure-function relationship of the
    brain circuits.


    Melika is the recipient of the 2023 “Swiss ERC” starting grant and ''Best Neuromorph''
    award at 2019 Telluride workshop. She has co-coordinated the European project
    [NEUROTECH](https://neurotechai.eu), is the program co-chair of the International
    Conference on Neuromorphic Systems (ICONS) and co-organizes the scientific program
    of the Capocaccia Neuromorphic Intelligence workshop.'

- description: 'Catherine (Katie) Schuman is an Assistant Professor in the Department
    of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee
    (UT). She received her Ph.D. in Computer Science from UT in 2015, where she completed
    her dissertation on the use of evolutionary algorithms to train spiking neural
    networks for neuromorphic systems. Katie previously served as a research scientist
    at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where her research focused on algorithms and
    applications of neuromorphic systems.


    Katie co-leads the TENNLab Neuromorphic Computing Research Group at UT. She has
    over 100 publications as well as seven patents in the field of neuromorphic computing.
    She received the Department of Energy Early Career Award in 2019.'

- description: 'Charlotte Frenkel is an Assistant Professor at the Microelectronics
    department of Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands.


    Her research goals are:

    - to demonstrate a competitive advantage for neuromorphic computing devices compared
    to conventional neural network accelerators,

    - to uncover a framework toward on-chip neuromorphic intelligence for adaptive
    edge computing.


    To achieve these goals, she is investigating both the bottom-up and the top-down
    design approaches, as well as their synergies.

    She is the designer of the [ODIN](https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ODIN) and [ReckOn](https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ReckOn)
    open-source online-learning digital neuromorphic processors.'
