title: "Henning Wessels"
description: "Henning Wessels is Assistant Professor at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technical University Braunschweig, where he is leading the data-driven modeling group. His group is developing computational methods at the intersection of mechanics, numerics, machine learning and uncertainty quantification. Applications can be found, for instance, in virtual sensing and structural health monitoring. Here, SNN offer huge potential for data-driven mechanics on neuromorphic hardware within embedded systems."
