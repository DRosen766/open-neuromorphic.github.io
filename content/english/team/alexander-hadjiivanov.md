title: "Alexander Hadjiivanov"
description: "Alexander is currently a Research Fellow with the Advanced Concepts Team at the European Space Agency. His research efforts are focused on retinomorphic vision as well as the interplay between homeostasis, adaptation, axon guidance and structural plasticity in spiking neural networks. 

No single branch of AI can claim the crown of true intelligence on its own. Rather, developing AI worthy of the 'I' would require a concerted effort to combine virtually all the branches - from perception through learning and cognition to reasoning and interaction. The most enticing aspect of neuromorphic computing is its potential to bring about this unification."
