This organisation is created by a loose collective of **open source** collaborators across academia, industry and individual contributors. What connects us is the love for building tools that can be used in the neuromorphic community and we want to share ownership of this vision. 

**Open Neuromorphic** (ONM) provides two things:

1. A curated list of **software frameworks** to make it easier to find **the tool you need**.
2. **A platform for your code**. If you wish to create a new repository or migrate your existing code to ONM, please get in touch with us. You will be made a member of this organisation immediately.

Projects that we list here can fall into this non-exclusive list of categories:

* **Spiking Neural Networks** (SNNs) training and/or inference, for both ML and neuroscience application.
* **Event-based sensors** data handling.
* **Digital hardware** designs for neuromorphic applications.
* **Mixed-signal** hardware designs for neuromorphic applications.
