### Speaker's bio
Trevor Bekolay’s primary research interest is in learning and memory. In his Master’s degree, he explored how to do supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in networks of biologically plausible spiking neurons. In his PhD, he applied this knowledge to the domain of speech to explore how sounds coming into the ear become high-level linguistic representations, and how those representations become sequences of vocal tract movements that produce speech.

Trevor is also passionate about reproducible science, particularly when complex software pipelines are involved. In 2013, he started a development effort to reimplement the Nengo neural simulator from scratch in Python, which has now grown to a project with over 20 contributors around the world.

## 2023-04-04: Gregor Lenz, Hands-on session with Sinabs and Speck

https://youtu.be/kOiyRtvPO2Q

### Speaker's bio

[Gregor Lenz](https://lenzgregor.com) graduated with a Ph.D. in neuromorphic engineering from Sorbonne University. He thinks that technology can learn a thing or two from how biological systems process information.

His main interests are event cameras that are inspired by the human retina and spiking neural networks that mimic human brain in an effort to teach machines to compute a bit more like humans do. At the very least there are some power efficiency gains to be made, but hopefully more! Also he loves to build open source software for spike-based machine learning. You can find more information on his personal website.

He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, [Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io) and [expelliarmus](https://expelliarmus.readthedocs.io).

### Speaker's bio

Konrad Kording runs his lab at the University of Pennsylvania. Konrad is interested in the question of how the brain solves the credit assignment problem and similarly how we should assign credit in the real world (through causality). In extension of this main thrust he is interested in applications of causality in biomedical research. Konrad has trained as student at ETH Zurich with Peter Konig, as postdoc at UCL London with Daniel Wolpert and at MIT with Josh Tenenbaum. After a decade at Northwestern University, he is now PIK professor at UPenn.
