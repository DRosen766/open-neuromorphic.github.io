## Academia


### UCSC Neuromorphic Computing Group - University of California Santa Cruz

![UCSC](ucsc-logo.png)

The [UCSC Neuromorphic Computing Group](https://ncg.ucsc.edu/) is led by professor [Jason Eshraghian](https://jasoneshraghian.com). 

We develop algorithms that can learn, and low-power architectures and circuits that harness exotic device technologies. Our work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, deep learning, and VLSI design. Check out our [opportunities page](https://ncg.ucsc.edu/join-us/).

**Contact:** jeshragh@ucsc.edu.

### Charlotte Frenkel's Laboratory - Delft University of Technology 

[Charlotte Frenkel](https://chfrenkel.github.io)'s researh group aims at bridging the bottom-up (bio-inspired) and top-down (engineering-driven) design approaches toward neuromorphic intelligence, with a focus on spiking neural network processor design, embedded machine learning, and on-chip training algorithms. The exact blend of design strategies (bottom-up / top-down) and of research areas (algorithms / hardware / neuroscience) depends on available positions and on the student's interests. Applicative use cases cover adaptive extreme-edge internet of things (IoT) devices, autonomous robotic agents, and biosignal processing.
