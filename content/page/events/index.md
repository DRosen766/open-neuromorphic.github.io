## 2023-05-31: Andreas Wild & Mathis Richter (Intel) 

![Lava](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68661711/135301797-400e163d-71a3-45f8-b35f-e849e8c74f0c.png)


### Event description

* **Title:** Lava - an open-source software framework for developing neuro-inspired applications.

* **Time:** 6PM - 7:30PM CET.

### Abstract
Lava is an open-source software framework for developing neuro-inspired applications and mapping them to heterogeneous neuromorphic hardware systems. Lava allows programming fast and energy efficient neuromorphic platforms at a high level of abstraction. This enables researchers and application experts to easily develop a broad range of neuromorphic applications that process, learn from, and respond to real-world data with unprecedent performance compared to conventional architectures. Lava currently supports applications on Intel’s Loihi 2 neuromorphic research chip as well as on CPU/GPUs. Our vision for Lava is to promote convergence toward a common software framework for the neuromorphic community and to spread the adoption of this emerging computing paradigm.

In this session, we will give an overview of Lava, explain the software stack along a few examples, and share our vision for Lava. There will be ample time for discussing the future of Lava and where the neuromorphic community is seeing critical roadblocks as well as exciting potential.

## 2023-07-19: Lana Josipović

![Lana Josipović](lana-josipovic.jpg)

* **Title:** From C/C++ to Dynamically Scheduled Circuits.

* **Time:** 6PM - 7:30PM CET.

### Abstract

High-level synthesis (HLS) tools generate digital hardware designs from high-level programming languages (e.g., C/C++) and promise to liberate designers from low-level hardware description details. Yet, HLS tools are still acceptable only for certain classes of applications and are criticized for the difficulty of extracting the desired level of performance: generating good circuits still requires tedious code restructuring and hardware design expertise. In this talk, I will present a new HLS methodology that produces dynamically scheduled, dataflow circuits out of C/C++ code; the resulting circuits achieve good performance out-of-the-box and realize behaviors that are beyond the capabilities of standard HLS tools. I will outline mathematical models to optimize the performance and area of the resulting circuits, as well as techniques to achieve characteristics that standard HLS cannot support, such as out-of-order memory accesses and speculative execution. These contributions redefine the HLS paradigm by introducing characteristics of modern superscalar processors to hardware designs; such behaviors are key for specialized computing to be successful in new contexts and broader application domains.

### Abstract

TBD.


### Speaker's bio

Giulia D’Angelo is a Neuroengineer, currently a Postdoctoral researcher at the Italian Institute of Technology in the Event Driven Perception for Robotics laboratory. Her current research takes advantage of bioinspired event-driven cameras and compact and low-power neuroinspired hardware for bioinspired visual algorithms. She obtained a Bachelor’s Degree in Biomedical Engineering at The University of Genoa in 2015. She, therefore, accomplished a Master’s Degree in Neuroengineering developing a neuromorphic algorithm for the egocentric representation of the peripersonal visual space at The King’s College of London. She received a Doctorate in bioinspired visual attention mechanisms for robotic applications exploiting neuromorphic architectures at The University of Manchester in 2022. She aims to emulate nature, bridging the gap between biologically plausible models of the visual system and bio-inspired hardware.

## 2023-01-26: Applied Brain Research

![Trevor Bekolay](trevor-bekolay.jpeg)

### Event description

* **Title:** Nengo - Applied Brain Research.

* **Time**: 6PM - 7:30PM CET.


### Speaker's bio

Trevor Bekolay’s primary research interest is in learning and memory. In his Master’s degree, he explored how to do supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in networks of biologically plausible spiking neurons. In his PhD, he applied this knowledge to the domain of speech to explore how sounds coming into the ear become high-level linguistic representations, and how those representations become sequences of vocal tract movements that produce speech.

Trevor is also passionate about reproducible science, particularly when complex software pipelines are involved. In 2013, he started a development effort to reimplement the Nengo neural simulator from scratch in Python, which has now grown to a project with over 20 contributors around the world.

 ![Gregor Lenz](gregor-lenz.jpeg)

### Event description

* **Abstract:** Hands-on session with Sinabs and Speck.

* **Time:** 6PM - 7:30PM CET.

### Speaker's bio

[Gregor Lenz](https://lenzgregor.com) graduated with a Ph.D. in neuromorphic engineering from Sorbonne University. He thinks that technology can learn a thing or two from how biological systems process information.

His main interests are event cameras that are inspired by the human retina and spiking neural networks that mimic human brain in an effort to teach machines to compute a bit more like humans do. At the very least there are some power efficiency gains to be made, but hopefully more! Also he loves to build open source software for spike-based machine learning. You can find more information on his personal website.

He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, [Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io) and [expelliarmus](https://expelliarmus.readthedocs.io).
