## 2023-01-26: Applied Brain Research

### Event description

* **Title:** Nengo - Applied Brain Research.

* **Time**: 6PM - 7:30PM CET.

* **Link:** https://forms.gle/AVnMQM8zopLYzRXu6.

### Speaker's bio

Trevor Bekolay’s primary research interest is in learning and memory. In his Master’s degree, he explored how to do supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in networks of biologically plausible spiking neurons. In his PhD, he applied this knowledge to the domain of speech to explore how sounds coming into the ear become high-level linguistic representations, and how those representations become sequences of vocal tract movements that produce speech.

Trevor is also passionate about reproducible science, particularly when complex software pipelines are involved. In 2013, he started a development effort to reimplement the Nengo neural simulator from scratch in Python, which has now grown to a project with over 20 contributors around the world.

## 2023-02-14: Giorgia Dellaferrera

### Event description 

* **Title:** PEPITA - A forward-forward alternative to backpropagation.

* **Time:** 6PM - 7:30PM CET.

### Speaker's bio

Giorgia Dellaferrera has completed her PhD in computational neuroscience at the Institute of Neuroinformatics (ETH Zurich and the University of Zurich) and IBM Research Zurich with Prof. Indiveri, Prof. Eleftheriou and Dr. Pantazi. Her doctoral thesis focused on the interplay between neuroscience and artificial intelligence, with an emphasis on learning mechanisms in brains and machines. During her PhD, she visited the lab of Prof. Kreiman at the Harvard Medical School (US), where she developed a biologically inspired training strategy for artificial neural networks. Before her PhD, Giorgia obtained a master in Applied Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and worked as an intern at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Logitech, Imperial College London, and EPFL.

## 2023-04-04: Gregor Lenz

### Event description

* **Abstract:** Hands-on session with Sinabs and Speck.

* **Time:** 6PM - 7:30PM CET.

### Speaker's bio

[Gregor Lenz](https://lenzgregor.com) graduated with a Ph.D. in neuromorphic engineering from Sorbonne University. He thinks that technology can learn a thing or two from how biological systems process information.

His main interests are event cameras that are inspired by the human retina and spiking neural networks that mimic human brain in an effort to teach machines to compute a bit more like humans do. At the very least there are some power efficiency gains to be made, but hopefully more! Also he loves to build open source software for spike-based machine learning. You can find more information on his personal website.

He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, [Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io) and [expelliarmus](https://expelliarmus.readthedocs.io).

### Event description

* **Title:** Lava.

* **Time:** 6PM - 7:30PM CET.

### Abstract

Lava is an open-source software framework for developing neuro-inspired applications and mapping them to neuromorphic hardware. Lava provides developers with the tools and abstractions to develop applications that fully exploit the principles of neural computation. Constrained in this way, like the brain, Lava applications allow neuromorphic platforms to intelligently process, learn from, and respond to real-world data with great gains in energy efficiency and speed compared to conventional computer architectures.
