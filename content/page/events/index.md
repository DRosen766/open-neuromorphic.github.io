**Time**: 6PM CET.

**Duration:** 90 minutes.

**Title:** Hands-on session with Speck and Sinabs.

**Bio:** Gregor Lenz currently works as a neuromorphic machine learning engineer at SynSense in Switzerland, where he focuses on low-power computer vision applications on spiking hardware. Before joining SynSense, he completed a doctoral degree in neuromorphic engineering at Sorbonne University in Paris, France, where his research focused on event-based algorithms on mobile devices and spiking neural networks on asynchronous hardware. For a year he worked as a research assistant at the Biomedical Image Analysis group at Imperial College London, UK and he holds a Master's degree in biomedical engineering from UAS Technikum Vienna, Austria. Gregor has authored several open-source software packages revolving around machine learning for spiking neural networks and is lucky to have won fellowships which allowed him to take part in neuromorphic workshops such as Telluride and Capocaccia.
