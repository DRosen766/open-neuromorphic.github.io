## 2023-09-25: Giulia D'Angelo, What's catching your eye? The visual attention mechanism

### Time
6PM-7:30PM, CEST.

### Abstract

Every agent, whether animal or robotic, needs to process its visual sensory input in an efficient way, to allow understanding of, and interaction with, the environment. The process of filtering revelant information out of the continuous bombardment of complex sensory data is called selective attention. Visual attention is the result of the complex interplay between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms to perceptually organise and understand the scene. Giulia will describe how to approach visual attention using bio-inspired models emulating the human visual system to allow robots to interact with their surroundings.

### Speaker's bio

Giulia D'Angelo is a postdoctoral researcher in neuroengineering in the EDPR laboratory at the Italian Institute of Technology. She obtained a B.Sc. in biomedical engineering and an M.Sc. in neuroengineering, developing a neuromorphic visual system at the King's College of London. She successfully defended her Ph.D. VIVA in 2022 at the university of Manchester, proposing a biologically plausible model for event-driven saliency-based visual attention. She is currently working on bio-inspired visual algorithms exploiting neuromorphic platforms.

### Speaker's bio
Tobias conducts interdisciplinary research at the intersection of intelligent robotics, computer vision, and computational cognition. His main goal is to develop high-performing, bio-inspired computer vision algorithms that simultaneously examine animals/humans and robots' perceptional capabilities. 

He is a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Queensland University of Technology's Centre for Robotics. He joined the Centre as an Associate Investigator and Research Fellow in January 2020. Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the Personal Robotics Lab at Imperial College London. 

He received a PhD from Imperial College in January 2019. His thesis was awarded the UK Best Thesis in Robotics Award 2018 and the Eryl Cadwaladr Davies Award for the best thesis in Imperial's EEE Department in 2017-2018. He previously received an M.Sc. degree (distinction) in Artificial Intelligence from The University of Edinburgh in 2014 and a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from Ilmenau University of Technology, Germany, in 2013. His works have attracted two best poster awards, one best paper award, and he was the senior author of the winning submission to the Facebook Mapillary Place Recognition Challenge 2020.
