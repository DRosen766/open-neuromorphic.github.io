## SNN training frameworks for neuroscience

Open-source software to train spiking neural networks. In these the tools, the goal is to emulate the human brain as efficiently as possible, instead of optimizing neuron model and simulation for speeding up AI tasks.

### Brian

![Brian](brian.png)

[Brian](https://briansimulator.org/) is a free, open source simulator for spiking neural networks. It is written in the Python programming language and is available on almost all platforms. We believe that a simulator should not only save the time of processors, but also the time of scientists. Brian is therefore designed to be easy to learn and use, highly flexible and easily extensible.

### NEST

![NEST](nest.png)

[NEST](https://www.nest-simulator.org/) is a simulator for spiking neural network models that focuses on the dynamics, size and structure of neural systems rather than on the exact morphology of individual neurons. The development of NEST is coordinated by the NEST Initiative.

NEST is ideal for networks of spiking neurons of any size, for example:

- models of information processing e.g. in the visual or auditory cortex of mammals,
- models of network activity dynamics, e.g. laminar cortical networks or balanced random networks,
- models of learning and plasticity.

## SNN training frameworks for ML and neuroscience

Open-source software to train spiking neural networks for both neuroscience and ML applications.

### Nengo

![Nengo](nengo.jpg)

[Nengo](https://nengo.ai) is a Python package for building, testing, and deploying neural networks. It supports plenty of backends for the SNN simulation.

### Lava

[Lava](https://lava-nc.org/) is an open-source software framework for developing neuro-inspired applications and mapping them to neuromorphic hardware. Lava provides developers with the tools and abstractions to develop applications that fully exploit the principles of neural computation. Constrained in this way, like the brain, Lava applications allow neuromorphic platforms to intelligently process, learn from, and respond to real-world data with great gains in energy efficiency and
speed compared to conventional computer architectures.

## Event-based data utilities

Open-source software to handle event-based data, including data generated by dynamic vision sensors and other neuromorphic sensors.

### Tonic

![Expelliarmus](expelliarmus.png)

[Expelliarmus](https://expelliarmus.readthedocs.io) is a Python/C package to decode binary files produced by Prophesee cameras. 

### AEStream - Address Event Streaming library

[AEStream](https://github.com/norse/aestream) parses event-based dynamic-vision system (DVS) data from an input source and streams it to a sink (GPU, CPU, network ports...).

### AEDAT

[AEDAT](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/aedat) is a fast AEDAT 4 python reader, with a Rust underlying implementation.

### Bimvee

![Bimvee](bimvee.png)

[BIMVEE](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/bimvee) is an open-source python library for Batch Import, Manipulation, Visualisation and Export of Events etc. It has import routines for several different event formats including, notably, a python-native unpacker of rpg-rosbags (no ROS installation required). It imports event data together with bundled data such as rgb images, point-clouds, IMU etc, handling timestamp synchronisation. It has visualisers with
intuitive defaults, allowing quick visualisation of the contents of event-data containers, and it has export routines for several data formats. Manipulations include time-stamp re-alignments, spatial cropping and event filtering. 

### MUSTARD

![MUSTARD](mustard.png)

[MUSTARD](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/mustard) is an open-source python application for playback of multistream data, including event-camera data. Each data stream present in a container (such as rosbag, but it can import any data-type which BIMVEE supports) opens a visualiser sub-window and data playback of all visualisers is controlled globally, including the speed, direction and time-window of visualisation. It has visualisers for events, rgb images, 6-DOF poses,
point-clouds, depth maps etc. 

## Digital hardware projects

Open-source digital hardware projects. 

### ODIN Spiking Neural Network (SNN) Processor

![ODIN](odin-frenkel.png)

[ODIN](https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ODIN) is an online-learning digital spiking neuromorphic processor designed and prototyped in 28-nm FDSOI CMOS at Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), published in 2019 in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems journal. ODIN is based on a single 256-neuron 64k-synapse crossbar neurosynaptic core with the following key features:

- synapses embed spike-dependent synaptic plasticity (SDSP)-based online learning,
- neurons can phenomenologically reproduce the 20 Izhikevich behaviors.

ODIN is thus a versatile experimentation platform for learning at the edge, while demonstrating (i) record neuron and synapse densities compared to all previously-proposed spiking neural networks (SNNs) and (ii) the lowest energy per synaptic operation across previously-proposed digital SNNs.

### ReckOn: A Spiking RNN Processor Enabling On-Chip Learning over Second-Long Timescales

![ReckOn](reckon-frenkel.png)

[ReckOn](https://github.com/ChFrenkel/ReckOn) is a spiking recurrent neural network (RNN) processor enabling on-chip learning over second-long timescales based on a modified version of the e-prop algorithm (we released a PyTorch implementation of the vanilla e-prop algorithm for leaky integrate-and-fire neurons here). It was prototyped and measured in 28-nm FDSOI CMOS at the Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, and published at the 2022 IEEE
International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) with the following three main claims:

- ReckOn demonstrates end-to-end on-chip learning over second-long timescales while keeping a milli-second temporal resolution,
- it provides a low-cost solution with a 0.45-mm² core area, 5.3pJ/SOP at 0.5V, and a memory overhead of only 0.8% compared to the equivalent inference-only network,
- it exploits a spike-based representation for task-agnostic learning toward user customization and chip repurposing at the edge.

### RANC - Reconfigurable Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing

![RANC](ranc.png)

[RANC](https://ua-rcl.github.io/RANC/) is a highly flexible environment that enables rapid experimentation with neuromorphic architectures in both software via C++ simulation and hardware via FPGA emulation. RANC enables hardware architects and application engineers to investigate and tune parameters of their neuromorphic architecture that would otherwise be unavailable on a purely prefabricated ASIC. This level of flexibility creates an environment that allows for optimizing
architectures based on application insights as well as prototyping future neuromorphic architectures that can support new classes of applications entirely.

### SNE: an Energy-Proportional Digital Accelerator for Sparse Event-Based Convolutions 

![SNE](sne-di-mauro.png)

[SNE](https://github.com/pulp-platform/sne) is a novel digital sparse neural engine (SNE) to efficiently accelerate SNN inference tasks at the extreme edge. The accelerator exploits an explicit input event temporal and spatial location encoding; the SNE architecture is designed to improve input data and weight reuse, reducing the traffic towards the memory. SNE achieves a maximum performance of 51.2 GSOP/s, and an energy efficiency of 4.5TSOP/s/W. Ultimately, SNE shows 3.55X higher
energy efficiency than SoA neuromorphic platform [16], approaching classical DNN accelerators energy efficiencies, while performing energy-proportional computations. As a proof of concept, it is shown that SNE consumes 0.221 pJ/SOP and achieves 92.8% accuracy on a classification task performed on the IBM DVS-Gesture data set.
