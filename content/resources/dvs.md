### Tonic

{{< image src="/img/resources/tonic.png" alt="tonic" >}}

[Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) is a tool to facilitate the download, manipulation and loading of event-based/spike-based data. It's like PyTorch Vision but for neuromorphic data!

### expelliarmus 

{{< image src="/img/resources/expelliarmus.png" alt="expelliarmus" >}}

[expelliarmus](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus) is a Python/C package to decode binary files produced by Prophesee cameras. 

### AEStream - Address Event Streaming library

[AEStream](https://github.com/norse/aestream) parses event-based dynamic-vision system (DVS) data from an input source and streams it to a sink (GPU, CPU, network ports...).

### AEDAT

[AEDAT](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/aedat) is a fast AEDAT 4 python reader, with a Rust underlying implementation.

### OpenEB

[OpenEB](https://github.com/prophesee-ai/openeb) is the open source project associated with [Metavision Intelligence](https://www.prophesee.ai/metavision-intelligence/).

It enables anyone to get a better understanding of event-based vision, directly interact with events and build their own applications or plugins. As a camera manufacturer, ensure your customers benefit from the most advanced event-based software suite available by building your own plugin.

### Bimvee

{{< image src="/img/resources/bimvee.png" alt="bimvee" >}}

[BIMVEE](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/bimvee) is an open-source python library for Batch Import, Manipulation, Visualisation and Export of Events etc. It has import routines for several different event formats including, notably, a python-native unpacker of rpg-rosbags (no ROS installation required). It imports event data together with bundled data such as rgb images, point-clouds, IMU etc, handling timestamp synchronisation. It has visualisers with intuitive defaults, allowing quick visualisation of the contents of event-data containers, and it has export routines for several data formats. Manipulations include time-stamp re-alignments, spatial cropping and event filtering. 

### Mustard

{{< image src="/img/resources/mustard.png" alt="mustard" >}}

[MUSTARD](https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/mustard) is an open-source python application for playback of multistream data, including event-camera data. Each data stream present in a container (such as rosbag, but it can import any data-type which BIMVEE supports) opens a visualiser sub-window and data playback of all visualisers is controlled globally, including the speed, direction and time-window of visualisation. It has visualisers for events, rgb images, 6-DOF poses, point-clouds, depth maps etc.
